# Space-Time Analysis Bayes (STAB) Research Group at University of Washington

 <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/ > Jon Wakefield </a> taught a class in Spatial Methods for Epidemiology at UW in 2006, and this lead to being on many PhD committees of students working on spatial health research, and these students have also been part of STAB, from a range of departments other than Statistics and Biostatistics including Epidemiology, Global Health, Sociology, Health Metrics Sciences and Geography. Jon's current and former students can be seen <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/people.html> here </a>. <a href=https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/geir-arne.fuglstad > Geir-Arne Fuglstad </a> and <a href=https://folk.ntnu.no/andrerie/ > Andrea Riebler </a> from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology came on sabbatical to UW in 2017-2018, and this has led to a long and enjoyable collaboration. The STAB Lab meets once a week and we have external speakers, usually over zoom, plus talks from group members. We discuss papers, and once every few weeks go around the group giving updates on our projects. We have an emphasis on spatial and spatio-temporal in a low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) context. The methods that group members develop are designed to be used by researchers in LMICs on their own data, and to this end we emphasize efficient methods and user-friendly software.  

We try to have as varied (in every sense) a group as possible and have an informal atmosphere in which everyone feels welcome and comfortable participating.
